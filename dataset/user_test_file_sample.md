Doctor: Hello, what seems to be the problem?
Patient: Recently, my left eye has been seeing things incompletely, with a shadow blocking part of my vision.
Doctor: How long has this been going on?
Patient: It's been about two to three months. At first, it got better after sleeping, but now it's getting worse.
Doctor: Can you describe the specific symptoms? For example, blurred vision or distortion?
Patient: My left eye is blurry, and I can't see in the central part of my vision, and there's some distortion.
Doctor: Have you had any previous eye conditions, like cataracts or glaucoma?
Patient: I have hypertension and take medication every day. I also have high myopia, over 800 degrees, and have had vitreous opacity and floaters for many years.
Doctor: Have you used any medications?
Patient: I bought some eye drops for early-stage cataracts from an online store.
Doctor: Are you taking any other oral medications?
Patient: I took Naphazoline and Vitamin B12.
Doctor: Do you have any history of allergies?
Patient: No.
Doctor: Besides the eye issues, are there any other discomforts?
Patient: Recently, I've also had some headaches.
Doctor: Based on your symptoms, I initially suspect retinal changes, possibly macular degeneration or retinal vascular bleeding.
Patient: Can this be cured?
Doctor: It should be possible to improve and control, but further examination is needed to confirm.
Patient: Should I go to the hospital for a check-up right away?
Doctor: Yes, I recommend you go to the ophthalmology department as soon as possible. You may need intravitreal injections.
Doctor: In the meantime, you can start taking Vortioxetine and Hemostatic Brightening Tablets.
Patient: I'm also taking Betaxolol for my hypertension. Can I take them together?
Doctor: Yes, you can. Follow the medication instructions I gave you and make sure to get an appointment for a check-up as soon as possible.
Patient: What might be the cause of this condition?
Doctor: It could be a problem with the retinal blood vessels. The exact cause needs to be determined by further hospital examinations.
Patient: Could it be related to any brain lesions?
Doctor: It doesn't seem likely. If it were a brain issue, other symptoms would have appeared within three months. This is mainly an eye problem.
Patient: Okay, thank you!
Doctor: You're welcome. I hope you recover soon! Remember to go to the hospital for a check-up as soon as possible.
